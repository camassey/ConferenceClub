#Contributing to Conference Club Fundamentals

There are a few areas you can help us make Conference Club more awesome.

##General reading
There is a huge amount of material out there about how to prepare for and give a great presentation. If you find something that you think others should read, a great place to put it is in the [Reading List](ReadingList.md).

As we add more resources, I'll try and categorise material to make it easier to navigate.

##Planning and exercises
The [main Conference Club page](README.md) is intended to be a walkthrough of presentation fundamentals, from the absolute basics (i.e. figuring out what you want to present on) through to actually giving a presentation.

I've initially used the structure laid out by [Rachel Davies](http://agilecoach.typepad.com/agile-coaching/2014/05/conference-club.html), and added subsections for "reading" and "exercises". Ideally, each step of these fundamentals should include ~3-5 good resources to give folks some foundations, and then some exercises to help them move forward.

The resources we use here will probably be cherry picked from the Reading List, but you can add stuff directly if you think it's really valuable (or is an exercise)

##Patterns and processes
This one is still up in the air - I'll set it up and see how it goes.

Basically, folks start the process of speaking at an event from different points, and find it easier to approach the challenge in various different ways. It would be useful to collect a few of those patterns and processes together so that people who are new to speaking can avoid pitfalls, pick up some pro tips, and generally find the approach that fits them best.
